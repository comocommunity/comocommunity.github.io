Bottom line: if the company is not licensed, do not let them in.</p>

                                        <p>A common method used by offenders to identify vacant properties is to knock on doors or ring doorbells to see if anyone answers and to listen for dogs barking. Offenders usually try more than once to be sure. Door knockers employed by legitimate companies are familiar with the Australia-wide ‘Do not knock’ campaign and leave as soon as they see the sticker. Failure to leave the property is breaking Australian Consumer Law and the company the door knocker represents could be fined up to $50,000. The door knocker is also committing trespass. By clearly identifying as a ‘do not knock’ property, anyone who then DOES knock is more readily identifiable as a potential criminal (or a scam company).

However, some information based resources are available from Neighbourhood Watch and this website lists what these are. There is just one Neighbourhood Watch Coordinator for the State (full time employee of WA Police). Most, if not all other states and territories, have now terminated this role.</p>
